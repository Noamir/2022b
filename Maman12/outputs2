===== NICE PRINT =====

Once when I was six 
years old I saw a ma
gnificent picture in
 a book, called True
 Stories from Nature
, about the primeval
 forest. It was a pi
cture of a boa const
rictor in the act of
 swallowing an anima
l. Here is a copy of
 the drawing.
In the book it said:
 "Boa constrictors s
wallow their prey wh
ole, without chewing
 it. After that they
 are not able to mov
e, and they sleep th
rough the six months
 that they need for 
digestion."
I pondered deeply, t
hen, over the advent
ures of the jungle. 
And after some work 
with a colored penci
l I succeeded in mak
ing my first drawing
. My Drawing Number 
One. It looked somet
hing like this:
I showed my masterpi
ece to the grown-ups
, and asked them whe
ther the drawing fri
ghtened them.
But they answered: "
Frighten? Why should
 any one be frighten
ed by a hat?"
My drawing was not a
 picture of a hat. I
t was a picture of a
 boa constrictor dig
esting an elephant. 
But since the grown-
ups were not able to
 understand it, I ma
de another drawing: 
I drew the inside of
 a boa constrictor, 
so that the grown-up
s could see it clear
ly. They always need
 to have things expl
ained. My Drawing Nu
mber Two looked like
 this:
The grown-ups' respo
nse, this time, was 
to advise me to lay 
aside my drawings of
 boa constrictors, w
hether from the insi
de or the outside, a
nd devote myself ins
tead to geography, h
istory, arithmetic, 
and grammar. That is
 why, at the age of 
six, I gave up what 
might have been a ma
gnificent career as 
a painter. I had bee
n disheartened by th
e failure of my Draw
ing Number One and m
y Drawing Number Two
. Grown-ups never un
derstand anything by
 themselves, and it 
is tiresome for chil
dren to be always an
d forever explaining
 things to them.
So then I chose anot
her profession, and 
learned to pilot air
planes. I have flown
 a little over all p
arts of the world; a
nd it is true that g
eography has been ve
ry useful to me. At 
a glance I can disti
nguish China from Ar
izona. If one gets l
ost in the night, su
ch knowledge is valu
able.
In the course of thi
s life I have had a 
great many encounter
s with a great many 
people who have been
 concerned with matt
ers of consequence. 
I have lived a great
 deal among grown-up
s. I have seen them 
intimately, close at
 hand. And that hasn
't much improved my 
opinion of them.
Whenever I met one o
f them who seemed to
 me at all clear-sig
hted, I tried the ex
periment of showing 
him my Drawing Numbe
r One, which I have 
always kept. I would
 try to find out, so
, if this was a pers
on of true understan
ding. But, whoever i
t was, he, or she, w
ould always say:
"That is a hat."
Then I would never t
alk to that person a
bout boa constrictor
s, or primeval fores
ts, or stars. I woul
d bring myself down 
to his level. I woul
d talk to him about 
bridge, and golf, an
d politics, and neck
ties. And the grown-
up would be greatly 
pleased to have met 
such a sensible man.
